
Document object:
The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the 
browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the 
element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can
add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be
accessed with a window.document or just document.

example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 
<head>
    <title>document's Properties</title>
    <style>
      h1 {
          color: green;
      }
    </style>
</head>
 
<body>
    
    <h1> Example </h1>
    <div id="eg"></div>
 
 
    <script>
        function fun() {
            var title = document.title;
            var domain = document.domain;
            var body = document.body;
            document.getElementById("eg").innerHTML =
            "the title of the document is : "+ title + domain+ body;
        }

fun();

    </script>
</body>
 
</html>

Window Object:
The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. 
It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents 
of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display 
the contents of the document, the window object is created. 

Syntax:

window.property_name;


example :

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
	<title> Window's Properties</title>
	<style>
		h1 {
			color: green;
		}
	</style>
</head>

<body>
	<h1>Example</h1>
	
	<p id="prop"></p>


	<script>
		function fun() {
			var h = window.innerHeight;
			var w = window.innerWidth;
			var l = window.location;
			var c = window.closed;
			document.getElementById("prop").innerHTML =h+w+l+c
		}

fun();
	</script>
</body>

</html>

Difference between document and window:
Document:
